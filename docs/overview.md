# Welcome to the xExchange DEX âš¡

## Quick notes:

## What is xExchange?

It's a DEX AMM running on the MultiversX (previously Elrond) Network. It is built by the same team that has built the MultiversX (previously Elrond) blockchain. You could call it the "official" DEX. There can be any number of DEX-es built on MultiversX (previously Elrond), but the team wanted to build the first one, because it is special.

## What's special about xExchange?

Well, a number of things:

**State Sharding**: The MultiversX (previously Elrond) blockchain is the first live blockchain with state sharding. Other chains with similar architectures, such as Ethereum 2.0, are still in development or are yet to enable state sharding. Anyone who wants to understand sharded DeFi should pay attention to MultiversX (previously Elrond) DeFi.

**SFTs LP Tokens**: trade, collateralize - Providing liquidity on xExchange gives you LP tokens, like most AMM DEXes. Uniquely in the space, the xExchange LP tokens are tradeable. This means you can provide liquidity, then sell your position, or take a loan against it (use LP tokens as collateral). Awesome and a DeFi first, because of MultiversXâ€™s (previously Elrond's) unique ESDT (Elrond Standard Digital Token) architecture.

**xPortal Mobile Wallet**: onboarding, 2FA - You can use MultiversXâ€™s (previously Elrond's) [xPortal app](https://xportal.com/) to login and sign transactions on xExchange. As secure as a Ledger hardware wallet, as convenient as Face ID + tapping on the screen.

Additionally, xPortal is super easy to use - it automatically and securely creates a wallet in seconds, using just a phone number (not shared, only a hash of it is used one time for wallet creation). ~500k users use xPortal, and it was just launched in February ~ 6 months ago.

## Why is xExchange important?

The MultiversX (previously Elrond) ecosystem has 200+ partners. With the launch of xExchange, the ESDT version of their tokens can be deployed in liquidity pools and expand access for their community. This will generate adoption for xExchange, volume, and generate more transactions on the MultiversX (previously Elrond) blockchain, increasing demand for EGLD in the process.

## When will xExchange launch?

The xExchange will launch in November.

## What is MEX?

MEX is the token powering xExchange. It is required for the governance of the decentralized exchange platform, as fuel for the perpetual decision-making process that will maintain the xExchange DEX ahead of the curve in terms of innovation, operational model, listing policies, and other actions aimed at creating a sustainable value cycle for its stakeholders. Furthermore, the MEX token is designed as a value capture mechanism and incentive vehicle that will allow the compelling attributes of the economical advancements it enables to scale with its adoption.
