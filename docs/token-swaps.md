# Token Swaps

Users can trade or swap an amount of tokens for an automated computed amount from the second token. The Automated Market Making concept relies on a mathematical formula to price assets. Instead of using an order book like a traditional exchange, assets are priced according to a pricing algorithm. Maiar DEX uses the Uniswap-like constant product formula x \* y = k, where x is the amount of one token in the liquidity pool, and y is the amount of the other. In this formula, k is a fixed constant, meaning the poolâ€™s total liquidity always has to remain the same.

There is a **0.3%** fee for swapping tokens. A part of this  fee, 0.25% is split by liquidity providers proportional to their contribution to liquidity reserves. The contract will buy MEX from the EGLD/MEX pool using the remaining 0.05% and burn it.

This is done via the following algorithm: whenever someone trades on the exchange, the trader pays a 0.3% fee, part of this is added to the liquidity pool.
