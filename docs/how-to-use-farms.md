# How to use Farms

## 1. The MEX Farm

### Staking:

1. Press “Stake”
2. Select the token: MEX or LKMEX. If LKMEX, select the type of LKMEX as well
3. Decide on the rewards type: unlocked MEX for regular APR, locked MEX for 2 x APR
4. Tick the “lock rewards” box accordingly
5. Acknowledge the 1% fee for withdrawing in the first 72 hours
6. Click “Continue”
7. You will be asked to sign 2 transactions, as per your login method -> confirm
8. The 2 transactions will be sent and your new balances will be automatically updated, pending the transactions’ execution

### Harvesting:

Multiple staking transactions with different rewards locking options will generate multiple individual positions in the farm. Each position is generating rewards as per the size of the position and type of rewards.

You can either harvest the rewards individually, all at once, or directly reinvest all rewards.

“Harvest” - harvests the available reward for that position. Rewards thus become available in your balances

“Reinvest” - reinvests the available reward for that position. Rewards are thus automatically staked into the farm. The rewards lock mechanism will be identical to the one for that position.

“Harvest all” - harvests all the available rewards for all the positions, at once. Rewards thus become available in your balances.

“Reinvest all” - reinvests all the available rewards for all positions. All the rewards are thus automatically staked into the farm. The rewards lock mechanisms will be identical to the respective positions.

### Withdrawing:

1. Click on “Withdraw” - notice the 1% penalty countdown, if applicable
2. Select the amount of MEX you want to withdraw
3. Click on “Continue”
