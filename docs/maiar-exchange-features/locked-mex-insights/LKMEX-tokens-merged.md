# How are Locked MEX tokens merged?

Over time, xExchange users will accumulate multiple different LKMEX tokens, one for each month. To make things easier for them, the Exchange will periodically and automatically consolidate these tokens, without changing their unlock schedule.

This has the benefit of allowing users to manage their LKMEX easier and with less gas cost.

For example, instead of 10 different tokens, each with 10 different unlock schedules, you get 1 token, with 10 different unlock schedules. The unlock schedules remain the same and unlocked MEX will be released towards the user as planned.
